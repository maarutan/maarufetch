- Operating system name
- Kernel version
- Desktop environment (WM)
- Shell information
- Number of installed packages (pacman)
- System uptime
- Memory usage (RAM)

## Features

- Displays system information in a visually appealing format.
- Uses Unicode icons and ANSI colors for better readability.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Linux-based operating system (tested on Arch Linux)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
````

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x script.py
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash

   ```

   Alternatively, you can run it directly with Python:

   ```
